## C Semantics Examples

This folder contains C programs that illustrate the various types of
errors that we can catch with our formal C semantics.

We recommend that you start with the [demo][] examples for a
high-level overview and then study the [error-codes][] examples
for an in-depth understanding of both the C undefinedness and
the bug-finding capabilities of our C semantics.
