Attempting to lock a PTHREAD_MUTEX_DEFAULT mutex that is already locked by the current thread:

        in locker_thread at UB-PTHREAD4-bad.c:15:5
    Locked here:
      > in pthread_mutex_lock at UB-PTHREAD4-bad.c:14:5
        in locker_thread at UB-PTHREAD4-bad.c:14:5

    Undefined behavior (UB-PTHREAD4):
